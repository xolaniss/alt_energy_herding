  abstract = {Commodities markets due to their unique characteristics that are they exhibit negative correlation with returns of traditional asset classes and are among the few assets that offer protection from the effects of inflation have recently garnered investors' attention especially through the development of commodity index financial products. This financialization process that started in the early 2000s and escalated after 2004 has precipitated price comovements among various types of commodities creating a proper setting for the examination of herding behavior. Employing a comprehensive dataset of investable commodities indices we examine the existence of herding behavior via static and time varying models. Our findings reveal no evidence of herding behavior according to static model. However, when rolling window analysis is in place significant anti-herding behavior is detected. These behavioral patterns are corroborated through a time varying stochastic volatility model. Our results contain significant implications for investors, commodities producers and policy makers.},

Results from the static model suggest no significant herding. However, the presence of structural breaks and nonlinearities in the data series suggests applying a static model is not appropriate. Accordingly, we conduct a rolling-window analysis, and those results point to significant herding behaviour, which varies over time. Using a logistic regression, we find that herding tends to occur as uncertainty increases. Our findings induce useful insights related to portfolio and risk management, trading strategies, and market efficiency.},

We find no evidence of herding on the part of market participants in the US and Hong Kong and partial evidence of herding in Japan. However, for South Korea and Taiwan, the two emerging markets in our sample, we document significant evidence of herding. The results are robust across various size-based portfolios and over time. Furthermore, macroeconomic information rather than firm-specific information tends to have a more significant impact on investor behavior in markets which exhibit herding. In all five markets, the rate of increase in security return dispersion as a function of the aggregate market return is higher in up market, relative to down market days. This is consistent with the directional asymmetry documented by McQueen et al. (1996) (McQueen, G., Pinegar, M.A., Thorley, S., 1996. Journal of Finance 51, 889--919).},

  abstract = {The Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) affected the financial markets since the year 2000. Asset managers and investors consider Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) as a popular investment vehicle that represents a source of growth for sustainable strategies. Clean Energy ETFs (CE ETF) are funds that invest in stocks of alternative energy sectors such as solar energy, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal companies. In 2022, CE ETF recorded a rate of return equal to 3.3\% in a quarter. We investigate the role of sustainable ETFs in portfolio management analyzing features of the most capitalized ETFs over the last decade (2012--2022), distinguishing between CE ETFs and Fossil Fuel ETFs (FF ETFs). Using daily quotes, we compare the performance of various mean variance portfolios each including only CE ETFs, only FF ETFs, and a mix of the two. We show that the CE ETFs portfolio does not always provide a better risk--return trade-off, but it often beats the FF one. Given the time-varying features of the volatility of ETF returns, we use a GARCH framework and analyze the various portfolios' performance in different sub-periods, to take into account the pandemic crisis, the Paris Agreement, and the Ukranian conflict. We find that portfolios' performance is highly affected by i) market conditions, and ii) sustainability-related events. In addition, with respect to our observation period, we show that the exclusion of FF ETFs does not decrease the profitability of the portfolios.},

We show that a nonlinear relationship and structural breaks exists between oil returns and various rare disaster risks; hence, linear Granger causality tests are misspecified and the linear model results of non-predictability are unreliable. However, the quantile-causality test shows that rare disaster-risks strongly affect both WTI returns and volatility, with stronger evidence of predictability observed at lower quantiles of the respective conditional distributions. Our results are robust to alternative specification of volatility (based on a GARCH model), and measure of rare disaster risks (based on the number of crises).},

The results indicate that US investors tend to herd during days when important macro data are released, and that there have been herding spill-over effects from the US to the UK during earlier financial crises. Further results reveal more differences in herding behavior between the two markets: in the US we find that investors herd due to both fundamentals and non-fundamentals during different crises, when in the UK there is herding only due to fundamentals and only during the Dotcom bubble burst. These results suggest that the drivers of herding behavior are period and country specific.},

Our evidence for the US and the Euroarea suggests that, during periods of high volatility, deviations from rational asset pricing are more persistent and spillovers between the markets are substantially amplified. In general, our findings show that during periods of crisis, like the recent global financial crisis and the period after the dot.com bubble bursting, stock prices are much more driven by behavioral effects compared to tranquil times.},

The estimator which minimizes the sum of absolute residuals is an important special case. Some equivariance properties and the joint asymptotic distribution of regression quantiles are established. These results permit a natural generalization of the linear model of certain well-known robust estimators of location. Estimators are suggested, which have comparable efficiency to least squares for Gaussian linear models while substantially out-performing the least-squares estimator over a wide class of non-Gaussian error distributions.}

Empirically, we reject the null hypothesis of multivariate normality for the negative tail, but not for the positive tail. We also find that correlation is not related to market volatility per se but to the market trend. Correlation increases in bear markets, but not in bull markets.},

This paper assesses the utility of green exchange-traded funds (ETFs), in the investors' portfolios for their dual potential of sustainability and diversification. ETFs provide a unique opportunity to construct practically investible portfolios and have long been used as conduits to facilitate project financing. In this paper, we use distinct ETFs based on dirty (conventional) and clean (green) energy products and companies, bonds, equity, ex-energy commodity, and real estate markets to examine the diversification benefits of green energy for a US-based investor. We construct efficient frontiers under different asset allocations and diversification strategies using the Markowitz MVO framework. Our results show that green energy ETFs provide significant diversification benefits and move the efficient frontier upward. In contrast, the portfolio performance deteriorates with dirty energy funds under different asset allocation and diversification strategies. Overall, we find that owing to their risk-return profile, green energy ETFs can be a rewarding alternative to dirty energy for investors in the global energy market.},

This implies that REIT investors tend to herd under turbulent market conditions. Our results also support the asymmetry of herding behaviors, that is, herding is more likely to occur and becomes stronger in declining markets than in rising markets. In addition, our findings show that the current financial crisis has caused a change in the circumstances under which herding can occur, as we find that during the current crisis REIT investors may not start to herd until the market becomes extremely turbulent whereas during the relatively normal period before the crisis, investors tend to herd when the market is moderately turbulent. Finally, we find that compared with the case of the `pre-modern' era, REIT investors are more likely to herd in the `modern' era, during which herding usually occurs when the market becomes tumultuous. This implies that the switch of REITs from passive externally managed entities into active self-managed ones has made the investors more responsive to market sentiment.},
