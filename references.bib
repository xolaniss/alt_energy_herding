This financialization process that started in the early 2000s and escalated after 2004 has precipitated price comovements among various types of commodities creating a proper setting for the examination of herding behavior. Employing a comprehensive dataset of investable commodities indices we examine the existence of herding behavior via static and time varying models. Our findings reveal no evidence of herding behavior according to static model. However, when rolling window analysis is in place significant anti-herding behavior is detected. These behavioral patterns are corroborated through a time varying stochastic volatility model. Our results contain significant implications for investors, commodities producers and policy makers.},

Results from the static model suggest no significant herding. However, the presence of structural breaks and nonlinearities in the data series suggests applying a static model is not appropriate. Accordingly, we conduct a rolling-window analysis, and those results point to significant herding behaviour, which varies over time. Using a logistic regression, we find that herding tends to occur as uncertainty increases. Our findings induce useful insights related to portfolio and risk management, trading strategies, and market efficiency.},

We find no evidence of herding on the part of market participants in the US and Hong Kong and partial evidence of herding in Japan. However, for South Korea and Taiwan, the two emerging markets in our sample, we document significant evidence of herding. The results are robust across various size-based portfolios and over time. Furthermore, macroeconomic information rather than firm-specific information tends to have a more significant impact on investor behavior in markets which exhibit herding. In all five markets, the rate of increase in security return dispersion as a function of the aggregate market return is higher in up market, relative to down market days. This is consistent with the directional asymmetry documented by McQueen et al. (1996) (McQueen, G., Pinegar, M.A., Thorley, S., 1996. Journal of Finance 51, 889--919).},

Asset managers and investors consider Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) as a popular investment vehicle that represents a source of growth for sustainable strategies. Clean Energy ETFs (CE ETF) are funds that invest in stocks of alternative energy sectors such as solar energy, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal companies. In 2022, CE ETF recorded a rate of return equal to 3.3\% in a quarter. We investigate the role of sustainable ETFs in portfolio management analyzing features of the most capitalized ETFs over the last decade (2012--2022), distinguishing between CE ETFs and Fossil Fuel ETFs (FF ETFs). Using daily quotes, we compare the performance of various mean variance portfolios each including only CE ETFs, only FF ETFs, and a mix of the two. We show that the CE ETFs portfolio does not always provide a better risk--return trade-off, but it often beats the FF one. Given the time-varying features of the volatility of ETF returns, we use a GARCH framework and analyze the various portfolios' performance in different sub-periods, to take into account the pandemic crisis, the Paris Agreement, and the Ukranian conflict. We find that portfolios' performance is highly affected by i) market conditions, and ii) sustainability-related events. In addition, with respect to our observation period, we show that the exclusion of FF ETFs does not decrease the profitability of the portfolios.},

We show that a nonlinear relationship and structural breaks exists between oil returns and various rare disaster risks; hence, linear Granger causality tests are misspecified and the linear model results of non-predictability are unreliable. However, the quantile-causality test shows that rare disaster-risks strongly affect both WTI returns and volatility, with stronger evidence of predictability observed at lower quantiles of the respective conditional distributions. Our results are robust to alternative specification of volatility (based on a GARCH model), and measure of rare disaster risks (based on the number of crises).},

The novel contribution of this article is to examine the herding behaviour during the whole, pre- and post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak period. We deployed the popular model proposed by Chang et al. (2000) to examine herd formation. Using daily stock closing prices of 191 firms, which constitute the 12 industry indices for the period from 1 January 2015 to 1 June 2020, the results for the full sample period (1 January 2015 to 1 June 2020) and before COVID-19 outbreak period (1 January 2015 to 29 January 2020) indicate the non-existence of herding formation at the industry level, but they do suggest a strong evidence of anti-herding behaviour. In addition, during the bull and bear market conditions, we found evidence of herding behaviour during the post-COVID-19 outbreak period (1 January 2020 to 1 June 2020). Further, the findings suggest that COVID-19 pandemic caused the formation of herding behaviour at the industry level. The study facilitates investors to devise their trading strategies in the regime of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

The results indicate that US investors tend to herd during days when important macro data are released, and that there have been herding spill-over effects from the US to the UK during earlier financial crises. Further results reveal more differences in herding behavior between the two markets: in the US we find that investors herd due to both fundamentals and non-fundamentals during different crises, when in the UK there is herding only due to fundamentals and only during the Dotcom bubble burst. These results suggest that the drivers of herding behavior are period and country specific.},

In particular, we examine how market capitalization, price to book value, Sharpe ratio and ESG score of large-cap firms in Europe are related to their stock performance. We consider a panel data consisting of six European countries---Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain, France and Germany---for the period 2010--2020. For Greek and French firms, a firm's size tends to negatively affect its stock returns. The investors in European countries (except Italy) do not jeopardize their returns by investing in highly ESG scoring firms. We argue that the benefit of not investing in highly ESG-scoring firms might lead investors to select smaller size companies with a higher price to book value and higher Sharpe ratio, as it is more likely to generate higher returns. Moreover, Italian firms are more susceptible to ESG issues, as ESG performance and stock return seem to have a significant negative correlation. This valuable result was confirmed by conducting a robustness test for Europe as a whole using the Euronext100 index. Finally, we find no evidence that ESG motivates herding in our selected sample (this is not the case for Greece and France), while we report evidence of ESG herding behavior during the Covid-19 outbreak in Portugal, Italy and Greece.},

  abstract = {Attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing has grown in recent years. Even after the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) global pandemic, there has been a rise in financial instruments that are structured according to certain prescribed ``sustainable finance'' objectives. From a risk management perspective, and as we continue to see a rise in inflows into such instruments, it is important to appreciate that ESG markets will have a growing influence on our financial system and its development. In light of this, and using a sample of some of the most common and popular US-based ESG index funds, this study explores the extent to which herding behaviors are present in such markets. From a regulatory point of view, such behaviors are important to identify, given that they can lead to excess price volatility, bubbles, and other such market-destabilizing phenomena. In addition, this study builds a framework for exploring whether Twitter-based economic uncertainty, which is arguably a forward-looking indicator of investors' expectations, can exacerbate herding behaviors in ESG markets. Overall, this study shows the following: (i) herding behaviors are present in ESG markets; (ii) rises in Twitter economic uncertainty can potentially exacerbate such herding; (iii) although ESG funds, like traditional asset classes, generally show a negative risk--return tradeoff, this can be driven by changes in Twitter economic uncertainty.},

To fill this void, this paper investigates whether diversifying into clean energy stocks or green bonds could reduce portfolio downside risk for investors holding dirty energy stocks or international equity indices. Specifically, the risks of equity portfolios are compared before and after they are blended with clean energy assets. The incremental impact on the portfolio risk profile is evaluated through variable weightings for clean energy assets. The persistence of diversification effects is then explored by changing the assessment period. Results show that both green bonds and clean energy stocks provide risk diversification benefits for investors with dirty energy stocks. However, green bonds reduce risk while clean energy stocks generally increase the risk of the international equity index portfolio. Further analysis indicates the robustness of the results for the recent COVID-19 period. The findings broaden the limited understanding of the risk reduction capacity of clean energy assets to conventional equities and provide useful implications for investors seeking to decarbonize their equities and portfolio managers designing optimal portfolios to hedge against downside risks.},

ETFs provide a unique opportunity to construct practically investible portfolios and have long been used as conduits to facilitate project financing. In this paper, we use distinct ETFs based on dirty (conventional) and clean (green) energy products and companies, bonds, equity, ex-energy commodity, and real estate markets to examine the diversification benefits of green energy for a US-based investor. We construct efficient frontiers under different asset allocations and diversification strategies using the Markowitz MVO framework. Our results show that green energy ETFs provide significant diversification benefits and move the efficient frontier upward. In contrast, the portfolio performance deteriorates with dirty energy funds under different asset allocation and diversification strategies. Overall, we find that owing to their risk-return profile, green energy ETFs can be a rewarding alternative to dirty energy for investors in the global energy market.},

  abstract = {In view of the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies, the purpose of the present study is to offer new insights on the herding behavior of cryptocurrencies. To this end, we employ market prices of the largest cryptocurrencies for a period extending from August of 2015 through February of 2018. Results derived from the standard testing procedure using ordinary least squares pointed to the existence of herding behavior in the cryptocurrencies' market. Evidence on herding effects are further corroborated employing a quantile regression that accounts for the asymmetric nature of cryptocurrencies' returns. However, herding behavior is no longer present when a more robust time-varying regression model is employed. Our results entail significant implications for researchers, investors and market authorities.},

  author = {Weiner, Robert J},
  abstract = {This paper looks at speculative behavior in the international oil market. Much of the blame for oil-market turbulence has been placed on speculators, particularly hedge funds. Speculative capital has been characterized as ``hot money,'' with capital flows driven by ``herding,'' ``flocking,'' and ``contagion.'' Policies to deal with volatility by weakening, or even disabling speculation, have been based largely on anecdote, convenience (speculators have long served as scapegoats for various problems), and ideology, rather than careful analysis. Part of the problem arises from the secrecy with which speculators operate. Because speculative trading cannot easily be observed, it is difficult to assess speculators' contribution, if any, to volatility. The paper utilizes a large, detailed database on individual trader positions in crude-oil and heating-oil futures markets. The paper is exploratory, with focus on measuring and assessing the tendency of speculators to herd (trade in the same direction as a group) and flock (trade in the same direction by subgroups of speculators).},

  abstract = {Our study investigates the market-wide herding behavior in the U.S. equity REIT market. Utilizing the quantile regression method, we find that herding is more likely to be present in the high quantiles of the REIT return dispersion. This implies that REIT investors tend to herd under turbulent market conditions. Our results also support the asymmetry of herding behaviors, that is, herding is more likely to occur and becomes stronger in declining markets than in rising markets. In addition, our findings show that the current financial crisis has caused a change in the circumstances under which herding can occur, as we find that during the current crisis REIT investors may not start to herd until the market becomes extremely turbulent whereas during the relatively normal period before the crisis, investors tend to herd when the market is moderately turbulent. Finally, we find that compared with the case of the `pre-modern' era, REIT investors are more likely to herd in the `modern' era, during which herding usually occurs when the market becomes tumultuous. This implies that the switch of REITs from passive externally managed entities into active self-managed ones has made the investors more responsive to market sentiment.},
